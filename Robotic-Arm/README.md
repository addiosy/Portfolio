# Robotic Arm Project

This was my first CAD project using **OnShape**. The design uses an **MG90 servo** and is intended for **3D printing**.  
It helped me get comfortable with:
- Modeling
- Extruding
- Editing in context
- Importing files from **GrabCAD**
- Exploring third-party plugins in OnShape

The STL file is designed to be printable by another member of our **robotics team**.

## 3D Model STL File

You can download the main assembly STL file for 3D printing here:

[Main_Assembly.stl](https://github.com/addiosy/Portfolio/blob/main/Robotic-Arm/CAD/Main_Assembly.stl?raw=true)

> Note: This STL is designed for 3D printing with an MG90 servo integrated. It was created as a learning project using OnShape.
