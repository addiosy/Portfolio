# Robotic Arm Project

This project is a 3D-printable robotic arm designed in **OnShape**. It was my first major project using the software and served as a great learning experience in 3D modeling, assembly, and part integration. The design is optimized for use with an **MG90 servo**.

This project helped me develop the following skills:
- Advanced 3D Modeling & Extruding
- In-Context Editing & Derived Features
- Importing and Integrating 3rd-Party Models from **GrabCAD** & **MKCAD**
- Utilizing OnShape Plug-ins

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

| Part | Quantity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 3D Printed Parts | 1 | See STL file below |
| MG90 Servo | 1 | |
| M3 Screws | 4 | For mounting the servo |

## Assembly

1.  **Print the STL file:** Download the `Main_Assembly.stl` file from the CAD folder.
2.  **Mount the servo:** Secure the MG90 servo in its designated slot using M3 screws.
3.  **Connect the linkages:** Attach the arm linkages to the servo horn.

## 3D Model STL File

You can download the main assembly STL file for 3D printing here:

[**Main_Assembly.stl**](https://github.com/addiosy/Portfolio/blob/main/Robotic-Arm/CAD/Main_Assembly.stl?raw=true)

> **Note:** This STL is designed for 3D printing with an MG90 servo integrated. It was created as a learning project using OnShape.
