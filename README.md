# Portfolio

This is a collection of my work and projects.

## About Me
I am a high school student at Sir Wilfrid Laurier Secondary School in London, Ontario, and a member of the **Ramferno** robotics team (FRC Team 3756). I am passionate about robotics and currently leading the CAD design for our upcoming robot using Onshape and SolidWorks. This portfolio showcases my journey and projects as I develop my skills in 3D modeling, design for 3D printing, and mechanical assembly.

## Projects

### Robotic Arm
- A 3D-printable robotic arm designed in OnShape as a learning project.
- **Technologies used:** OnShape, 3D Printing
- [View Project Details](Robotic-Arm/README.md)

### Gear Ratio Practice
- A 6-speed manual transmission model designed to practice and visualize the application of gear ratios.
- **Technologies used:** OnShape
- [View Project Details](Manual-Transmission/README.md)

### Robotic Chassis (Work in Progress)
- A project to practice modeling a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) chassis with swerve modules.
- **Technologies used:** SolidWorks, OnShape
