# Portfolio

This is a collection of my work and projects.

## About Me
I am a high school student at Sir Wilfrid Laurier Secondary School in London, Ontario, and a member of the **Ramferno** robotics team (FRC Team 3756). I am passionate about robotics and currently leading the CAD design for our upcoming robot using Onshape and SolidWorks. This portfolio showcases my journey and projects as I develop my skills in 3D modeling, design for 3D printing, and mechanical assembly.
